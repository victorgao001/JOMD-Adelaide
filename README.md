# Setup

To setup the bot first clone the repository and cd into it

```
git clone https://github.com/zzaria/JOMD.git
cd JOMD
```


Make sure you have python3.7 installed.

```
apt-get install python3.7
```

Install relevant packages

```
pip3.7 install -r requirements.txt
```

Creeate a `.env` file, with JOMD_BOT_TOKEN as the discord bot token and JOMD_TOKEN s the DMOJ api token

```
BOT_TOKEN=x
JOMD_TOKEN=x
```

**JOMD also uses SQLAlchemy as a orm and Alembic as a migration tool. You need to make sure the database is upto date**

**If you have cloned this repository before the addition of Alembic, find the corresponding hash in /alembic and run**

```
alembic stamp <HASH>
```

Then run

```
alembic upgrade head
```

Run the bot with

```
python3.7 Main.py
```


**Warning**: Many of the commands require multiple pieces of information to be fetched, so many initial commands will take several seconds to run but will speed up as more information is fetched and stored.

# Usage
